Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Official Rules, you and Sponsor are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.

If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;). The Notice to Sponsor should be sent to Dragonfly Operations, LLC at 66 Franklin Street, Suite 300, Oakland, CA 94607 (&ldquo;Notice Address&rdquo;). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Sponsor and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Sponsor may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Sponsor or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Sponsor is entitled.</span></p><ol class="c2 lst-kix_list_3-0" start="4"><li class="c22"><span class="c9">Arbitration Procedures</span><span class="c0">. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association&rsquo;s (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) rules and procedures, including the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA&rsquo;s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Official Rules as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Official Rules and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</span></li></ol><p class="c16"><span class="c0">Unless Sponsor and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Sponsor agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</span></p><p class="c16 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c2 lst-kix_list_3-0" start="5"><li class="c8"><span class="c9">Costs of Arbitration</span><span class="c0">. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the</span></li></ol><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arbitration Fees&rdquo;) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Sponsor will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Sponsor will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Sponsor will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Finally, if the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, Sponsor will pay reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees should you prevail. Sponsor will not seek attorneys&rsquo; fees from you. But, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in relief, the payment of attorneys&rsquo; fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</span></p><ol class="c2 lst-kix_list_3-0" start="6"><li class="c8"><span class="c9">Confidentiality</span><span class="c0">.

If a court decides that any of the provisions of Section 8(b) is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. &nbsp;The remainder of these Official Rules will continue to apply.</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c2 lst-kix_list_3-0" start="8"><li class="c40"><span class="c9">Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</span><span class="c0">.
